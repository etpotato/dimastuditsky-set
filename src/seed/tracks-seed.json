His remixes were released on famous labels such as Sonar Kollektiv, Munich Compost Records. For more than 10 years now, Studitsky together with his partner in crime Ilya Rasskazov is running the internet-radio project called Headz.FM, and the infamous club nights of the same name, which have hosted Gilles Peterson, Ame, DJ Krush, Jazzanova, Domu, Kyoto Jazz Massive, and dozens of other outstanding DJs and musicians.",

    "description": "Another mix woven skillfully by the hands from the capital, it is soulfully filled with captivating downtempo rhythms. Here you'll find a gentle breeze and a cozy atmosphere. So, wherever you may be, simply surrender to the moment and enjoy the next hour!\n\nDima Studitsky has been standing behind the turntables for almost three decades, and his sets resonate with intelligent and beautiful eclecticism, encompassing a wide range of genres from ambient, downtempo, and dub to the most current manifestations of house, techno, and broken beats. As a producer, he is highly valued and recognized not only in Moscow and Russia but also beyond, thanks to his releases on Compost Records, Sonar Kollektiv, Peppermint Jam, and King Street. In his discography, you can find remixes of artists such as Jazzanova, DJ Cam, and Radio Citizen. He has also participated in major European festivals such as Southern Soul and Sunsplash, and in Moscow, his sets could be heard warming up for Ame and Gilles Peterson, Kuniyuki Takahashi and Karizma, DJ Krush, and Peter Kruder.\n\n@studitsky\ninstagram.com/dimastuditsky\n\nSubscribe to TAKT\ntaplink.cc/takt.rec",
